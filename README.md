# ðŸ”¥ WINNER PICK ðŸ”¥

Because it only counts if you pick the winner.

The goal of this app is to pick the winner of a series of a reality TV show. The MVP will be to have teams draft their players and for their player to be one of the winners for all the bragging rights.

For example, it will be based off of the reality TV show, Survivor.

## Description:
1. User must be able to login and have access to their dashboard
2. User must have the ability to create a group for other users to join
    - "Group" would be the game session itself with all the details

    - Number of cast members (those who are on the TV show)
    - Number of players (Users) - is this needed??

    - How many sessions the game will last - is this needed?? - this would be the same as how many cast members there are.
3. Users must be able to join a group for a fantasy reality TV game
4. Users in the Group must be able to draft befor the game begins
    - Round-robin the Users can select a cast member, until all are selected
    - Should there be an element of random dice to determine selection order?
    - What do we do with leftovers who don't get picked? Does the computer get to play with them?
5. Each session one cast member goes home
    - The User no longer gains points from that cast member once they are eliminated
    - Need the ability to add a session to assign who was eliminated each session
    - Each session 1 point is awarded for cast members remaining in the game
        - further points can be determined once this is working
